# :construction: geoAI
Module on geospatial data prediction and remote sensing of the Honour Degree Programm „AI und Entrepreneurship"

## Responsible for the module
Lisa Bald, Kevin Frac, Thomas Nauss, Christoph Reudenbach and Dirk Zeuss (in agreement with Hanna Meyer, University of Münster, https://www.uni-muenster.de/RemoteSensing/team/meyer/index.html for use in teaching there as well).  

## Learning objectives
Students will be able to
- pre-process and standardise highly diverse, large (remote sensing) data sets in a question-specific manner,
- classify spatial data (e.g. from point measurements, surveys, remote sensing) based on their properties and understand the resulting characteristics of spatial or spatio-temporal predictions,
- select, adapt and apply machine learning methods to solve spatio-temporal problems in human-environment research,
- design, apply and evaluate training/testing strategies for reliable error and validity estimation,
- select and create appropriate representations for visual analysis and presentation of results
- document their approach and results in a comprehensible and transparent manner, and analyse and critically evaluate the results.
- use digital platforms for collaborative project management, software development and active data management,
- work together in teams in an agile manner,

## Syllabus
The course spans 10 sessions, with the exception of session 10 on a weekly basis.
Spatial issues and spatial data
1. Many of humanity's major challenges are spatial. Learn about the importance of spatial configuration using the IPBES framework Nature's Contributions to People as an example.
2. spatio-temporal information. Learn about and appreciate the importance of spatial and temporal scales of data for environmental science issues.
3. remote sensing. Refresh your knowledge of spatially continuous and spatially explicit measurement techniques.
Spatial data and spatio-temporal predictions.
4. "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things." (Tobler 1970) On the invalidity of the first law of geography in heterogeneous spaces.
From data reproduction to spatial prediction. Why latitude and longitude are (almost) never good predictive variables.
6. spatial variable selection and validation strategies.
Randomly good or resilient
7. random good. Prediction of spatial features with machine learning and random validation.  
8. spatial good. Resilient spatial predictions using appropriate selection and validation strategies.
Final project in a team: Spatio-temporal prediction.
9. development, documentation and discussion of a spatio-temporally resilient prediction strategy on the basis of selectable, exemplary research questions.
10. examination performance (2-3 weeks after unit 9): presentation of the results (poster, webinar or similar according to a concrete blended learning concept in the specific study programme).
