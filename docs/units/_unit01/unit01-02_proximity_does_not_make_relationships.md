## On the invalidity of the first law of geography in heterogeneous spaces.
"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things" (Tobler, 1970). With this sentence, Waldo R. Tobler made geographic history, although he was primarily concerned with reducing the complexity of his population simulation model in order for it to be calculated on the IT infrastructure of the 1970s. Fifty years later, society is facing other major challenges.

## Interpolation is no prediction

## Kriging is not the answer (examples) (potential spotlight)
This is an example of simple Euclidean distances vs. complex spped-based distances.
