## Background
To set up a working or project environment, the first steps are normally to define different folder paths and load the necessary R packages as well as additional functions. If you also need to access additional software, like GIS, the appropriate binaries and software environments must be linked, too. Factoring in the major operating systems and the potentially multiple versions of software installed on a single system results in almost unlimited combinations of set ups.

We value freedom of choice as an important good. But given our long-term experience as instructors of similar courses, there is no freedom of choice when it comes to the mandatory working environment for this course. The reason for this is simple: Assignments and chunks of code written on person A's laptop should run on person B's computer without requiring any changes. The greater the number of systems that should be able to run the code, the nastier this potential situation can become. So, let's save everyone's time and focus on the things that are really important. Once the course is finished, feel free to use any working environment structure you like.

## Assignment
Set up the [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container){:target="_blank"} with all of the necessary software for this course (more to follow soon).
