This course introduces you to using artificial intelligence (AI) in the geosciences. Over approximately 10 sessions, you will learn about remote sensing as well as how to work with different types of spatial data and use AI to make spatial predictions about variables. 

The first two units introduce concepts that are critical to environmental geography. The next two units build upon this basis by introducing methods for using AI to make reliable predictions of variables in space where no measurements are available. Finally, the last unit(s) guide you through the process of conducting your own project with spatial data and how to implement, document and present your research.

This course assumes some basic knowledge of AI and some previous experience with the programming language R. If you need to refresh your knowledge about AI, we recommend reviewing the introductory courses from the Honours KI program before you continue with GeoAI. If you have little or no experience using R, we recommend reviewing some of the instructors' other online coursework available at OER Marburg, such as [Base R](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/){:target="_blank"} and a more advanced [Data Analysis in R](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-mpg-data-analysis/){:target="_blank"}.


## This session
This unit serves to give you your footing in this course by tackling the notion that big questions are spatial. First, it introduces the idea of habitat by using the IPBES framework "nature's contributions to people" (NCP) as its context. Then, it presents a method for describing how related things are to one another -- known as Tobler's first law of geography -- and challenges this idea for heterogeneous spaces.


## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to

* describe how nature contributes to human society,
* understand how artificial intelligence is applicable in the geosciences,
* and judge whether Tobler's "first law of geography" is valid
