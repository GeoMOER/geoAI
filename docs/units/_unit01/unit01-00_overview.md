The approach to the topic of spatio-temporal relationships and their digital representation seems unclear for both beginners and experts. 
In general, it involves the perception of spatial patterns and interactions in order to arrive at an understanding and description of the underlying processes. This is a scientifically based abstracted cognitive spatially focused experience of the world that enables the basis for understanding environmental change, assessing consequences and deriving responses or solutions.

This unit summarizes the basic abstraction and communication concepts of GI based space against the background of application-oriented scientific questions.


## Geo-science

The relationships of the real world are usually so complex that they can only be understood or analyzed in a generalized form. As early as 1927, the physicist Bridgman notes: "I believe that the model is a useful and indeed unescapable tool of thought, in that it enables us to think about the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar" [Bridgman 1927](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2014223?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents){:target="_blank"}. As a result the perception and interpretation of the "real world" as well as the development of appropriate strategies for the practical handling of this world, takes place with the aid of abstraction and communication (= modeling).


## Concepts of spatial representation

For doing so  geographic or spatial representations are the basis for a scientific interpretation of spatiotemporal aspects of the real world. In science, it is customary for this to be considered as valid rules (axioms). For example, Waldo Tobler has formulated the so-called first geographical law: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things" [Tobler 1970](https://www.jstor.org/stable/143141){:target="_blank"}. By contrast, in his action-centered approach, Benno Werlen points out that not only are real neighborhood relationships of objects or feature expressions permitting space constructs, but that spaces can also be defined by e.g. Acting people who do not necessarily act in spatial proximity can be socially constructed (see, for example, [Werlen 1993](https://www.erdkunde.uni-bonn.de/archive/1993/gibt-es-eine-geographie-ohne-raum-zum-verhaeltnis-von-traditioneller-geographie-und-zeitgenoessischen-gesellschaften/at_download/attachment){:target="_blank"}. 

But even in the quantitatively scientific representation of the world, the concept of neighborhood according to Tobler is only valid for some contexts. For example, the concentration of nitrogen in the atmosphere is comparatively homogeneous and continuous, while, for example, geologically continuous units on continental plates or disturbances from one meter to the next as a ditch or wall implies virtually counteract the neighborly relationships. 
So we have to find a way to define and integrate such conflicting spatial representations in a traceable and reproducible way.

## Limitation of world representations 

Despite these outlined  limitations, representations of space are permanently and urgently needed in order to document, analyze and communicate comprehensible spatial information. In the our field of geography, we need a combination of methods that make spatio-temporal relationships comprehensible, reproducible and adequate.


## This session
This unit serves to give you your footing in this course by tackling the notion that big questions are spatial. First it gives a short idea idea of the complex (inter)action of people with nature using the IPBES framework "nature's contributions to people" (NCP) as its context. 
In the next part spatial concepts and their digital representation are outlined and finally some methods for describing how spatial context of  heterogeneous spaces can be derived. 

  

## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to

* outline the major interaction of nature and people according to the NCP framework
* recognise spatial relationships and be able to classify important abstract concepts
* understand when spatial proximity is a robust explanation for processes and interactions, i.e. relationships
