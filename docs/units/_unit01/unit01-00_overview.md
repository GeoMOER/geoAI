This course introduces you to using artificial intelligence (AI) in the geosciences. Over approximately 10 sessions, you will learn about remote sensing as well as how to work with different types of spatial data and use AI to make predictions about variables in space. Unit 1 introduces the topic of habitat through the IPBES framework nature's contributions to people (NCP) and challenges Tobler's first law of geography in heterogeneous spaces.

## Big questions are spatial


## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to

* describe how nature contributes to human society,
* understand how artificial intelligence is applicable in the geosciences,
* and judge whether Tobler's "first law of geography" is valid
