What is a habitat, anyway?

<!--more-->
## Spatial composition of landscape
A habitat is a species-specific term that describes the physical, environmental and biotic factors of where a species can survive.

## Nature's Contributions to People
This framework by the [Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)](https://ipbes.net/){:target="_blank"} represents all of the contributions, both positive and negative, that nature makes to people's quality of life and includes diversity of organisms, ecosystems and their associated ecological and evolutionary processes. IPBES strives to "assess and promote knowledge of Earth's biodiversity and ecosystems and their contribution to human societies in order to inform policy formulation.

## Why do we need aritifical intelligence and geodata?
In short, because space matters.

The slightly longer and more nuanced answer is the purpose of this course. Regardless of whether we are interested in air temperature, degree of vegetation coverage, or solar irradiance at a given location, geodata always have a spatial component. But just because two points on the Earth are close together, they are not necessarily similar in every respect. After all, different topographies can mean that moving just a few meters in one direction has a very drastic result in your altitude -- just think of valleys, cliffs or mountain peaks as clear examples. This idea will be investigated more thoroughly in the next lesson.
