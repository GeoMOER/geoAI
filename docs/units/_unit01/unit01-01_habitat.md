What is a habitat, anyway?

<!--more-->
## Spatial composition of landscape
A habitat is a species-specific term that describes the physical, environmental and biotic factors of where a species can survive.

## Nature's Contributions to People
This framework by the [Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)](https://ipbes.net/){:target="_blank"} represents all of the contributions, both positive and negative, that nature makes to people's quality of life and includes diversity of organisms, ecosystems and their associated ecological and evolutionary processes. IPBES strives to "assess and promote knowledge of Earth's biodiversity and ecosystems and their contribution to human societies in order to inform policy formulation.

## Why do we need aritifical intelligence and geodata?
In short, because space matters. Let's illustrate this point by considering a historical example. In 1854, the London district Soho experienced a [cholera outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak). While the prevailing theory of disease at the time suggested that airborne particles ("miasma") was the source of the outbreak, [Dr. John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow) had another idea. After interviewing residents, he theorized that the the public water pump on Broad Street was responsible for the outbreak. Dr. Snow mapped the cases, visualizing the connection between space (Soho, London) and spatial processes (cholera outbreak), and showed that the closer a house was located to the Broad Street water pump, the greater number of cholera-related deaths occurred there. His pioneering work was a major milestone in the field of health geography and considered the founding of the field of epidemiology.

The slightly longer and more nuanced answer is the purpose of this course. Regardless of whether we are interested in air temperature, degree of vegetation coverage, or solar irradiance at a given location, geodata always have a spatial component. But just because two points on the Earth are close together, they are not necessarily similar in every respect. After all, different topographies can mean that moving just a few meters in one direction has a very drastic result in your altitude -- just think of valleys, cliffs or mountain peaks as clear examples. This idea will be investigated more thoroughly in the next lesson.
