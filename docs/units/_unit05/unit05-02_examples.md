Below you can find some examples for research question or topics, which you might work on in your final team project.
However, you are encouraged to work on self-developed research questions in your projects! 

Some ideas for your team project might be related to the classification, quantification, or change detection of

* orchard meadows, hedges, or any biotope type
* cars, bicycles roads, parking lots
* solar panels, pools, trampolines,
* rooftop greening 
* city parks
* bridges
* wind parks
* airfields
* military structures
* ...

# Where to get data?
After identifying the research question, a critical step is to find or create appropriate data sets for your modeling workflow.
Some data source suggestions are:

## Digital Orthophotos Hesse

We can provide you with DOP data for the study area of your research question in Hesse.
Theses data will be provided by the Hessische Verwaltung für Bodenmanagement und Geoinformation.
Therefore, they require the  bounding boxes of your study area as shapefile.
Note that these data inquiries will need several days to process, so please send us your shapefiles in due time.
Please also take into consideration that the file size and hence processing time of the DOPs depends on the selected study area.
As a rough guideline,1GB roughly corresponds to 30km² (40cm resolution, RGBA).


## Digital Orthophotos North Rhine-Westphalia
You can also download almost all geodata of North Rhine-Westphalia ([Geoportal NRW](https://www.geoportal.nrw/)) free of charge.
Next to the DOPs there is also the possibility to download some shapefiles which could be used as mask data.
   
   
## Sentinel-2
If your research question focuses on a topic with a larger extent or is out of the boundaries of Hesse/North Rhine-Westphalia, it is presumably required to download your data somewhere else. One possible data source is the Sentinel-2 mission. You already know how to download Sentinel-2 data via the `sen2r-package`.
   
## Create your own shapefile
Next to the known possibility to download your shapefiles from different sources (e.g. [Geoportal NRW](https://www.geoportal.nrw/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.de/),`...`). You have also learnt to create your own shapefiles. This could be necessary if there is no available data set for your (specific) topic.
