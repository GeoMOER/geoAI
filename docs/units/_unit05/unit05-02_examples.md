# Where to get data?

## DOP

### Hesse

We can provide you with DOP data for the study area of your research question in Hesse.
Theses data will be provided by the Hessische Verwaltung für Bodenmanagement und Geoinformation.
Therefore, they require the  bounding boxes of your study area as shapefile.
Note that these data inquiries will need several days to process, so please send us your shapefiles in due time.
Please also take into consideration that the file size and hence processing time of the DOPs depends on the selected study area.
As a rough guideline,1GB roughly corresponds to 8km² (40cm resolution, RGBA) **check**.
