## Project outline

### Content and structure
The project outline should include
* a title, of course, 
* the authors,
* an introduction outlining the state of the art, research need and relevance of the expected results in the context of your research question,
* a data section describing the intended data you are planning to use,
* a method section with details on the methods you plan to apply on your data for getting an answer to you research question,
* a discussion section, where you discuss the implications, conclusions, potential limitations and improvements, picking up the story you created in the introduction, 
* a timetable with important work packages and milestones you aim to work on for reaching the project goal, and 
* references on relevant scientific papers, which have been published in the context of your research question.

Note that the project outline should not exceed two pages.
These pages will help the instructors to give feedback on especially the feasibility of your project. 

For details on how to organize and upload your project outline, see the *assignment* pages in this unit.


## Research project

After you have written your project outlines and have received feedback on it, 
it will be your task to realize a full research project on the basis of your project outline and individual feedback.


### Content and structure

The content and structure of your research project follows your project outline, with a few modifications, see below.
The final product of your research project will be a research article.


### Format

* Create one pdf file.
* Follow the structure you already used for the project outline.
* Do not exceed 5000 words (excluding references).
* Make your format consistent, e.g. font size, line spacing, text in display items, references, citations,  etc. 
* Use a serif-free font.
* Create visually appealing display items. This is especially true for your main display item(s).
* Include an abstract after the title, which mirrors the content and structure of your project (250 words maximum).
* Do not include a timetable (only in the project outline).
* Do a sound literature review and properly cite peer-reviewed articles. Roughly aim to include 20-50 references.



### Working in groups

You are encouraged to work in groups of up to four persons.
This has the advantage that you can split up different work packages, 
but has the disadvantage that you are also responsible for harmonizing the different parts into one seamless piece of work without redundancies.
One submission for one group is sufficient.
Note that we expect group submissions to be larger in the total amount of work compared to single persons submitting individual work.
