## Choosing a research question

Now it is your turn to decide for a self-chosen research question to work on in your final team project.
Your question can emphasize the methodological aspects or explicitly focus on the results of an area-wide spatial prediction, or both.



## Project management and implementation

Creativity in research and project management are not incompatible. 
In fact, professional research requires the definition of some kind of aim or the organization of tasks in time schedules. 


Common project management steps are:

* Define the research question project and its objectives,
* break down the project into tasks and define a schedule,
* get and prepare the data you need for reaching your objectives
* design workflows for each task and implement them, and last but not least
* adjust your tasks, solve problems and be flexible.

Obviously, it makes sense to start your research project with a short **project outline**, which should include the project management steps outlined above.
Based on your project outline and the feedback we will give you on it, you will realize and submit your final team project.
See the *Requirements* page in this unit for details.
