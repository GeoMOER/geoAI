Final team project: spatial prediction

## Recap
In Unit 4, we looked at spatial prediction. From a simple random forest model without spatial aspects, we developed a modeling approach that takes into account the spatiality of the data in different parts of the modeling. In the second part we dealt with the recognition of spatial structures using the convolutional neuronal network unet.
