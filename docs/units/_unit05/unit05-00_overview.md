Final team project: spatial prediction

## Recap
In Unit 4, we looked at spatial prediction. From a simple random forest model without spatial aspects, we developed a modeling approach that takes into account the spatiality of the data in different parts of the modeling. In the second part we dealt with the recognition of spatial structures using the convolutional neuronal network unet.


## This session

You have almost made it!  This is the last unit of the course in which you can now apply what you have learned in the past weeks. 
Now you will be challenged to create your own project from scratch that uses a machine learning method for spatial prediction. You may work in teams to do this. You can either build on the methods covered in the course or create your own concept of your choice, just make sure that you take the unique features of spatial prediction into consideration.



## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to
* Developing a research question from the beginning
* Plan a project from scratch
* Develop and document your project on your own
* Present your project in an appropriate format
