Final team project: spatial prediction

## Recap
In Unit 3, we looked at spatial prediction. From a simple random forest model without spatial aspects, 
we developed a modeling approach that takes into account the spatiality of the data in different parts of the modeling. 
In Unit 4 we dealt with the recognition of spatial structures using the convolutional neuronal network Unet.


## This unit

You have almost made it!  This is the last unit of the course in which you will apply what you have learned in the past units. 
Now you will be challenged to create your own project from scratch that uses a machine learning or deep learning method for making spatial predictions.


## Learning objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to
* develop a research question,
* plan and realize a research project from scratch, and
* present your project in an appropriate format.
