Final team project: spatial prediction

## Recap
In Unit 4, we looked at spatial prediction. From a simple random forest model without spatial aspects, we developed a modeling approach that takes into account the spatiality of the data in different parts of the modeling. In the second part we dealt with the recognition of spatial structures using the convolutional neuronal network unet.

## This session

In diesem letzten Kursabschnitt soll jeder 

* A suitable variable selection for spatial data,
* create a basic random forest model with random cross-validation

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to

* explain why spatial variable selection is important
* prepare your data for machine learning,
* understand the basic concept of random forest,
* train a random forest model with random cross-validation, 
* Determine the suitability of random cross-validation as a validation strategy for spatial data.
