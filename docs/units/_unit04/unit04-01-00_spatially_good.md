Resilient spatial predictions using appropriate selection and validation strategies.

<!--more-->
We are once again trying to predict tree species for a forest area in Rhineland-Palatinate. This time we will use two new methods to improve the predictions. Familiarize yourself with the topics by watching the following videos and reading the corresponding articles.

## Leave-Location-Out (LLO) cross-validation
