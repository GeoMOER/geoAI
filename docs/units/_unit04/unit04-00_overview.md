Spatial predictions and robust error estimation
<!--more-->

## Recap

In the last unit we discussed the importance of a spatial variable selection for a spatial prediction. Furthermore you built your first random forest model with a random cross-validation. If you do remember your results (if not have a look at them now) you will have noticed that the Error estimate is quite low even if we have an inaccurate prediction.

## This Session

To fix this problem, we will create a prediction that takes into account the spatiality of the data. Today we will try to create a "proper" spatial prediction.  To do this, the model created in the last unit will be used as follows. 
We will then delve a little deeper into the field of spatial prediction, using a deep learning convolutional neural network to recognize spatial structures.


## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to

* adapt your random forest model from the last unit to a
