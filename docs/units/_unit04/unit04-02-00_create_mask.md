In this exercise we will create a raster mask from vectordata containing the outlines of all buildings in our study area in the south of Marburg (figure below). For this purpose, both the raster mask and the DOP of the study area will be split from large raster (.tif) files into many smaller image files (.png).

## Create raster mask from vector file

From the file shown in the figure above, containing the outlines of the buildings in the study area, we will first create a raster mask. To do this, we use the DOP of the study area as a reference raster, to ensure that the mask will have the same extent and the same resolution. The transformation of polygons into a raster file with the same properties as the DOP is done by the function rasterize of the raster package. Afterwards a reclassification of the values is performed, where all values that do not represent a building are 0 and all values that represent a building are 1. You can roughly see how the mask for the study area might look in the map below (layer mask).

```r
# read data
input_vector <- sf::read_sf("01_raw_data/vector/test_mar_build.gpkg")
r <- raster::stack("01_raw_data/aerial/test_mar_dop.tif")

# rasterize
rasterized_vector <- rasterize(input_vector,r[[1]])

# reclassify
rasterized_vector[is.na(rasterized_vector[])] <- 0
rasterized_vector[rasterized_vector > 1] <- 1

#save
raster::writeRaster(rasterized_vector,"./data/sow/sow_mask.tif",overwrite=T)
```


## Function to split the data


To train the unet, many smaller images of the same size are needed instead of the large raster files we have at the moment. We will use the function below to split the raster files. Although it may seem a bit complex at first glance, it basically consists of five simple steps: 

1. determine the size of the original raster (DOP)
2. determine how many images of a certain size (e.g. 128 by 128) can fit into it and how large the extent of all the images is in total.
3. crop the original grid to the new size (a multiple of 128x128).
4. create a grid with polygons over the cropped raster (see layer images in the image below)
5. crop every polygon to both the house mask and the DOP and save the small 128x128 images as .png

```r

subset_ds <-
  function(input_raster,
           model_input_shape,
           path,
           targetname = "",
           mask = FALSE) {
    # determine next number of quadrats in x and y direction, by simple rounding
    targetsizeX <- model_input_shape[1]
    targetsizeY <- model_input_shape[2]
    inputX <- ncol(input_raster)
    inputY <- nrow(input_raster)
    
    # determine dimensions of raster so that
    # it can be split by whole number of subsets (by shrinking it)
    while (inputX %% targetsizeX != 0) {
      inputX = inputX - 1
    }
    while (inputY %% targetsizeY != 0) {
      inputY = inputY - 1
    }
    
    # determine difference
    diffX <- ncol(input_raster) - inputX
    diffY <- nrow(input_raster) - inputY
    
    # determine new dimensions of raster and crop,
    # cutting evenly on all sides if possible
    newXmin <- floor(diffX / 2)
    newXmax <- ncol(input_raster) - ceiling(diffX / 2) - 1
    newYmin <- floor(diffY / 2)
    newYmax <- nrow(input_raster) - ceiling(diffY / 2) - 1
    rst_cropped <-
      suppressMessages(crop(
        input_raster,
        extent(input_raster, newYmin, newYmax, newXmin, newXmax)
      ))
    
    agg <-
      suppressMessages(aggregate(rst_cropped[[1]], c(targetsizeX, targetsizeY)))
    agg[]    <- suppressMessages(1:ncell(agg))
    agg_poly <- suppressMessages(rasterToPolygons(agg))
    names(agg_poly) <- "polis"
    
    if (mask) {
      future_lapply(
        seq_along(agg),
        FUN = function(i) {
          subs <- local({
            e1  <- extent(agg_poly[agg_poly$polis == i, ])
            
            subs <- suppressMessages(crop(rst_cropped, e1))
            
          })
          writePNG(
            as.array(subs),
            target = paste0(path, targetname, i, ".png")
          )
        }
      )
    }
    else{
      future_lapply(
        seq_along(agg),
        FUN = function(i) {
          subs <- local({
            e1  <- extent(agg_poly[agg_poly$polis == i, ])
            
            subs <- suppressMessages(crop(rst_cropped, e1))
            # rescale to 0-1, for png export
            if (mask == FALSE) {
              subs <-
                suppressMessages((subs - cellStats(subs, "min")) / (cellStats(subs, "max") -
                                                                      cellStats(subs, "min")))
            }
          })
          writePNG(
            as.array(subs),
            target = paste0(path, targetname, i, ".png")
          )
        }
      )
    }
    rm(subs, agg, agg_poly)
    gc()
    return(rst_cropped)
  }

## Function to remove files without training data

In this example we will only use the images to train the unet that also contains one of the objects we want to detect (a building). Therefore we will use the following function to remove from all .pngs, that have only one value in the mask (0 no house), both the mask image and the corresponding DOP .png.

```r

remove_files <- function(df) {
  future_lapply(
    seq(1, nrow(df)),
    FUN = function(i) {
      local({
        fil = df$list_m[i]
        png = readPNG(fil)
        len = length(png)
        if (AllEqual(png)) {
          file.remove(df$list_s[i])
          file.remove(df$list_m[i])
        } else {
        }
      })
    }
  )
}
```




## Split Mask and DOP and remove empty files

Now we can apply our functions defined above to our data. Both the DOP and the mask are split into smaller .pngs using the subset_ds function. The output path for both functions is in a different folder, where the images should be stored.  

```r
rasterized_vector <- stack("02_modelling/masks/test_mar_mask.tif")


# subsets for the mask
target_rst <- subset_ds(
  input_raster = rasterized_vector,
  path = "02_modelling/masks/split/",
  mask = TRUE,
  model_input_shape = c(128,128) # set the size of the output images
)


# subsets for the training data
input_raster <- raster::stack("01_raw_data/aerial/test_mar_dop.tif")

subset_ds(
  input_raster = input_raster,
  path = "02_modelling/aerial/split/",
  mask = FALSE,
  model_input_shape = c(128,128)
)
```

All files from these two folders are sorted into a dataframe and then the files that do not contain houses in the image in the mask column get deleted.

```r
list_dops <-
  list.files(s_path, full.names = TRUE, pattern = "*.png")
list_masks <-
  list.files(m_path, full.names = TRUE, pattern = "*.png")
df = data.frame(list_dops, list_masks)

remove_files(df)

```
