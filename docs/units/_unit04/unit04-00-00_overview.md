Deep-learning and spatial patterns
<!--more-->

## Recap

In the previous exercise, you already got a first impression of the different datasets used and dealt with them in R. You also created a first simple random forest model for the prediction of tree species. For this you relied on classical methods of machine learning like n-fold cross-validation. In the second part you performed a spatial prediction with forward feature selection and leave-location-out cross-validation.

## This Session
We will now delve a little deeper into the field of spatial prediction and use a Deep Learning convolutional neural network to detect traditional orchard meadows.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to


* understand the basic concept of a U-net deep neural network
* to get your first U-net up and running and to recognize some spatial structures with it
