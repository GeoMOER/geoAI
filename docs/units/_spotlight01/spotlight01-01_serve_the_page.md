Start creating your page locally with Jekyll and then push it to GitHub to create a GitHub page.
<!--more-->

## Locally

Switch to the /docs folder on your command promt and run "bundle exec jekyll serve"
* If you received no errors you can open the page in a browser following the address given in the terminal (something like "Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/my-great-page/")
* If this worked you can proceed with serving the page on GitHub


## On GitHub

* Push your local changes to GitHub (if any).
* Use your browser and navigate to the settings of your GitHub repo and turn on "GitHub Pages" under "pages" on the left. 
	* Select the master branch as source and /docs as folder
* The url for your GitHub page can also be found there.
* Note that pushed changed will take a while to be processed by GitHub and will not instantly be availaby globally (this might take 1-5 minutes).
