Creating digital training areas for supervised classifications of remote sensing imagery

<!--more-->


### Why we need training areas
Training areas are the basis of supervised classification. Creating training areas allows us, the user, to tell the computer what we see in an image. It transfers the knowledge that we have about individual objects in an image to a digital level. Once we have enough training areas, we can feed them into a machine learning algorithms to classify the remaining pixels of an image. This process is called supervised classification.

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised classification
