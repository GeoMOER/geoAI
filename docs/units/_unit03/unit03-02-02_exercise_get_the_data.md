In this exersice you prepare the data that is neccessary to predict tree species groups for a forest in Rhineland-Palatinate with Random Forest.


## 1. Sentinel-2 data

* Download a winter and a summer Sentinel-2 scene from here,
* Load all bands into R and plot an RGB image of one scene,
* Calculate a bunch of vegetation indices on both scenes (Have a look at the RStoolbox for this),	
	
## 2. LiDAR

* calculate lidar indices


## 3. Forest inverntory data


* load the Polygons containing the forest inventory data
* filter them to a tree species purity of at least 80%
