Predicting spatial features with machine learning and random validation. 

<!--more-->
## The goal


We will try to predict tree species and their successional stages for a forest in Rhineland-Palatinate with machine learning (random forest), Sentinel-2, LiDAR and forest inverntory data. 


## The purpose
Forests are the largest terrestrial Ecosystem in the world and provide a lot of ecosystem services to human wellbeing. Due to drought, parasites (bark beetle), and climate change the forests in europe are exposed to extrem stress. 
Information about the tree species and the successional stages are quite valuable as the forest composition can be used as an coarse proxy for the habitat of certain species.
