Resilient spatial predictions using appropriate selection and validation strategies.

<!--more-->

We are once again trying to predict orchard meadow in Hesse. This time we will use two new methods to improve the predictions. To address the issue of autocorrelation in spatial predictions (see e.g [Ploton et al. 2020]( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18321-y)) we will swap the random cross-validation with a spatial [Leave-Location-Out (LLO)](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/CAST/versions/0.5.1/topics/CreateSpacetimeFolds) cross-validation. For this we use the function CreateSpacetimeFolds from the R package [CAST]( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CAST/CAST.pdf).  

To perform a spatial variable selection, we will use another function from the same package, a [Forward-Feature-Selection (FFS)](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/CAST/versions/0.2.0/topics/ffs). 

Familiarize yourself with the topics by reading the corresponding article.
