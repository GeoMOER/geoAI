Machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, can be trained to find patterns in empirical data that are invisible to humans. Better yet, as long as the training data is representative, these patterns can be used to predict for spaces for which no data is present, which is the goal of this course. But being randomly correct is not the same as a prediction.

## Recap

In the last unit, you became familiar with optical remote sensing systems and the characteristics that affect how satellite (or other airborne) sensors capture information about the real world and represent it digitally. We also investigated cases, in which it is appropriate to use remote sensing imagery together with the naked eye, physical models and AI to answer questions about the environment.

## This session

In this unit, we will use remote sensing data as the basis for making spatial predictions of **Streuobstwiese** (traditional orchard meadows). First, we will familiarize ourselves with random forest models and a simple cross-validation procedure to evaluate the model. Then, we will use these tools to predict **Streuobstwiese** in the German state Hesse. In the second part of this unit, we will adapt the modeling and validation procedures in a way that explicitly addresses the spatial nature of the data. For this purpose, we will use novel geoscience methods to perform a spatial variable selection as well as a spatial cross-validation.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to

* prepare your data for machine learning,
* train a random forest model with random cross-validation, 
* understand the concept of a forward feature selection (FFS) and leave-location-out (LLO) cross-validation
* perform FFS and LLO cross-validation to make your modeling workflow spatially robust
