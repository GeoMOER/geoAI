Randomly correct is not predicted

## Recap

* ...

## This session

In this unit we will explore the spatial prediction of tree species. We will first get familiar with random forest models and a simple cross-validation. We will use our newly acquired knowledge to predict orchard meadows in Hessen. In the second part of this unit we will then adapt the random forest model to take more account to the spatiality of the data. For this purpose, we will perform a spatial variable selection and a spatial cross-validation.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to


* prepare your data for machine learning,
* train a random forest model with random cross-validation, 
* understand the concept of a forward-feature-selection (FFS) and Leave-Location-Out (LLO) cross-validation
* adapt your modeling workflow to perform FFS and LLO cross-validation
