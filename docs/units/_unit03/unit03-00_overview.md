Randomly correct is not predicted

## Recap

* ...

## This session

In this unit we will explore the spatial prediction of tree species. We will first get familiar with random forest models and a simple cross-validation. We will use our newly acquired knowledge to predict tree species for a forest area in Rhineland-Palatinate. Finally, we will evaluate whether the results obtained with this method are satisfactory and discuss possibilities for improvement.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to

* explain why spatial variable selection is important
* prepare your data for machine learning,
* understand the basic concept of random forest,
* train a random forest model with random cross-validation, 
* Determine the suitability of random cross-validation as a validation strategy for spatial data.
