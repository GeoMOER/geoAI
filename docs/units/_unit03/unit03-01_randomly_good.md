## Random forest -- The basics
To accomplish this task, we will use a [random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) machine learning approach. Random forests can be used for both regression or classification tasks, the latter of which is particularly relevant in environmental remote sensing. As with all other machine learning methods, the random forest model learns to recognize patterns and structures in the data on its own.

The random forest algorithm learns about the data by building many decision trees -- hence, the name "forest". For classification tasks, as in the above diagram, the algorithm takes an instance from the training dataset and each tree (again, there are many) classifies that instance into a class. Ultimately, the instance is assigned to the class that is the outcome of the most trees. Of course, this is an oversimplified description of how random forest works. If you are interested in theory and math behind how the algorithm truly works, please see the paper by Breiman (linked below).

Since the random forest algorithm requires training data, it is a supervised learning method. This means that we, as users, must tell the algorithm what it is supposed to predict. In our case, in order for the algorithm to classify areas of **Streuobstwiese** correctly, the training data must include and be labeled with different categories or land cover classifications (i.e., field, building, forest, water).

### Machine learning
Here are several videos that introduce the broad field of machine learning, in general, as well as the specific algorithm that we will use in this course: random forest. In addition to these videos, we encourage you to conduct independent research, as there are some great tutorials on the Internet.
